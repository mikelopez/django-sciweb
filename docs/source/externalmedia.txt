External Media & Templates
======================================

Here we will configure our templates, css/javascript & images directories. 
Comes with Twitter Bootstrap for default CSS & JS
When creating a custom domain folder, each subdirectory of that should be a directory named as the site stripped of all prefixes. 
By default, it will search for domains/ folder, with the subdirectory named as the website (site123.com) and the requested template filename. If that is not found, it will search through the parent directory of domains/ (apps/mainweb/templates/index.html) for the index.html file or the template filename associated with the WebsitePage()

Example Directory Structure example::

  sciweb/
      apps/
          mainweb/
               templates/
                    show_product.html
                    index.html
                    show_article.html
                    search.html
                    products.html
                    articles.html
                    domains/
                         sitename.com/
                               index.html
                               search.html
                               .....
                         domain-cool.com/
                               index.html
                               search.html
                               .....
                         hot-a55-orgy.com/
                               index.html
                               search.html
                               .....



Setting up the domains/ symlink 
=================================

It is recommended to use a symlink for the domains "directory" to a directory outside of your project.

* Place a symlink in sciweb/apps/mainweb/templates/ called "domains" that points to any other directories that contain any HTML templates or you can create the directory as well as a local folder to the project. Must be called: domains ``ln -s /directory/for/your/templates sciweb/apps/mainweb/templates/domains``

* Optional: Create a directory called sciweb/static/domains add to .gitignore (must be called domains) ``ln -s /directory/for/your/templates/static/ sciweb/static/domains``


Website Default and Sub Templates
==================================

By default, there is a set of templates located inside ``sciweb/apps/mainweb/templates/`` 

These templates are used if there is no subdirectory ``domains`` inside of ``sciweb/apps/mainweb/templates``

NOTE: Templates inside the subdirectories must contain the same naming as the default templates.
so if you are accessing domain.com, and we have sciweb/apps/mainweb/templates/domains/domain.com/index.html, we will
serve that file, otherwise, we serve the default sciweb/apps/mainweb/templates/index.html


Default Template Filenames
==========================

- index.html
- show_product.html
- show_article.html
- search.html
- products.html
- articles.html


Linked Media Subdirectories
===========================

Similar to the templates directory structure, we have a default directory ``sciweb/static``
This directory is set with MEDIA_URL of /src/ (This can be overrided in local_settings.py)

As of 0.9, we will check for a sub directory inside of the static media directory ``settings.MEDIA_ROOT`` called ``domains``
If you are accessing domain.com, it will search for ``sciweb/static/domains/domain.com/`` for any directories called ``bootstrap``
If it is found, then it is used and overrides the default bootstrap files that are being used.


The user can choose to use ``{{MEDIA_URL}}/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.css`` to use the default bootstrap.css file
