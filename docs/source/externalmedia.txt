External Media & Templates
======================================

Here we will configure our templates, css/javascript & images directories. 
Comes with Twitter Bootstrap for default CSS & JS


* Place a symlink in sciweb/apps/mainweb/templates/ called "domains" that points to any other directories that contain any HTML templates or you can create the directory as well as a local folder to the project. Must be called "domains"

``ln -s /directory/for/your/templates sciweb/templates/domains``

2) (optional) Create a directory called sciweb/static/domains add to .gitignore (must be called domains)

``ln -s /directory/for/your/templates/static/ sciweb/static/domains``


Website Default and Sub Templates
==================================

By default, there is a set of templates located inside ``sciweb/apps/mainweb/templates/`` 

These templates are used if there is no subdirectory ``domains`` inside of ``sciweb/apps/mainweb/templates``

NOTE: Templates inside the subdirectories must contain the same naming as the default templates.
so if you are accessing domain.com, and we have sciweb/apps/mainweb/templates/domains/domain.com/index.html, we will
serve that file, otherwise, we serve the default sciweb/apps/mainweb/templates/index.html


Default Template Filenames
==========================

- index.html
- show_product.html
- show_article.html
- search.html
- products.html
- articles.html


Linked Media Subdirectories
===========================

Similar to the templates directory structure, we have a default directory ``sciweb/static``
This directory is set with MEDIA_URL of /src/ (This can be overrided in local_settings.py)

As of 0.9, we will check for a sub directory inside of the static media directory ``settings.MEDIA_ROOT`` called ``domains``
If you are accessing domain.com, it will search for ``sciweb/static/domains/domain.com/`` for any directories called ``bootstrap``
If it is found, then it is used and overrides the default bootstrap files that are being used.


The user can choose to use ``{{MEDIA_URL}}/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.css`` to use the default bootstrap.css file

TODO: Need to set the context processor to create a default static media variable usable in all templates which contains 
the link to the directory where media/template files are found. As of now, hardcoding the media urls into the HTML markup is required 
to explicitly access a file
