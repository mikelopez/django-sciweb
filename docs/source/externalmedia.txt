External Media & Templates
======================================

Here we will configure our templates, css/javascript & images directories. 

Includes Twitter Bootstrap for the default CSS & JS. 

When creating a custom domain folder, each subdirectory of that should be a directory named as the site stripped of all prefixes.

By default, it will search for domains/ folder, with the subdirectory named as the website (site123.com) and the requested template filename from the WebsitePage() table. If that is not found, it will search through the parent directory of domains/ (apps/mainweb/templates/index.html) for the template filename associated with the WebsitePage()

Example Directory Structure example::

  sciweb/
      apps/
          mainweb/
               templates/
                    show_product.html
                    index.html
                    show_article.html
                    search.html
                    products.html
                    articles.html
                    domains/
                         sitename.com/
                               index.html
                               search.html
                               .....
                         domain-cool.com/
                               index.html
                               search.html
                               .....
                         hot-a55-orgy.com/
                               index.html
                               search.html
                               .....



Setting up the domains/ symlink 
=================================

It is recommended to use a symlink for the domains "directory" to a directory outside of your project.

* Place a symlink in sciweb/apps/mainweb/templates/ called "domains" that points to any other directories that contain any HTML templates or you can create the directory as well as a local folder to the project. Must be called: domains ``ln -s /directory/for/your/templates sciweb/apps/mainweb/templates/domains``

* Optional: Create a directory called sciweb/static/domains add to .gitignore (must be called domains) ``ln -s /directory/for/your/templates/static/ sciweb/static/domains``


Website Default and Sub Templates
==================================

By default, there is a set of templates located inside ``sciweb/apps/mainweb/templates/`` 

These templates are used if there is no subdirectory ``domains`` inside of ``sciweb/apps/mainweb/templates``

.. note:: Templates inside the subdirectories must contain the same naming as the default templates. so if you are accessing domain.com, and we have sciweb/apps/mainweb/templates/domains/domain.com/index.html, we will serve that file, otherwise, we serve the default sciweb/apps/mainweb/templates/index.html


Default Template Filenames
==========================

- index.html
- show_product.html
- show_article.html
- search.html
- products.html
- articles.html


Linked Media Subdirectories
===========================

Similar to the templates directory structure, we have a default directory ``sciweb/static``
This directory is set with MEDIA_URL of /src/ (This can be overrided in local_settings.py)

The user can now use staticfiles ``{% /bootstrap/css/bootstrap.css`` to use the default bootstrap.css file


.. note ::
As of 1.0 it now uses staticfiles which makes use of settings.STATICFILES_DIRS
